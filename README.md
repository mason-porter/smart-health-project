### Project Setup
To run the project, you will need the following software:
* [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) 3.7.5+
* [XCode](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (Debug and Emulation Environment) 13.2.1+
* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) 1.11.3+

Additional setup help is below:

#### Flutter 
The only requirement is that flutter is download and unzipped on your system.

#### XCode 
When XCode is finished downloading, go to Preferences -> Locations, and set 'Command Line Tools' to whatever version of XCode you are using.

#### CocoaPods
Required for device simulation on XCode. Restart XCode after installing if it is open.
